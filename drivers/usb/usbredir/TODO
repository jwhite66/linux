TODO:
  *  All the prints of port # should also print hub #
  *  Still getting sporadic failures
  *  Hmm.  KFP_ATOMIC on our mallocs may be better than _KERNEL...
  *  Read and deal with the many TODOs
  *  Not just hacking the usbredirparser, but proper patches
     - The filter needs love.  Use strsep, not strtok?
  *  Expose a sysfs attribute and have udev use it
  *  Turn on more capabilities and watch it go
