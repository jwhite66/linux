TODO:
  *  Test connect, and then disconnect for cleanup
  *  Test destroying a device via the detach function
  *  Current code has no event thread, which, afaict, was just used
     to tear the device down.  Can we do without it?
  *  Either way, we need to implement tear down code
  *  Hmm.  KFP_ATOMIC on our mallocs may be better than _KERNEL...
  *  Read and deal with the many TODOs
  *  Make a dequeue_urb work correctly.
      - Probably want to send a message, if possible,
        but then really do the dequeue as well
  *  Not just hacking the usbredirparser, but proper patches
  *  Why is the thumb drive read only
  *  Expose a sysfs attribute and have udev use it
  *  Turn on more capabilities and watch it go
