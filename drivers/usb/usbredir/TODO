TODO:
  *  Getting sporadic failures, and we can't read/write data
     to the drive just yet.  Probably something not quite right.
  *  Hmm.  KFP_ATOMIC on our mallocs may be better than _KERNEL...
  *  Read and deal with the many TODOs
  *  Make a dequeue_urb work correctly.
      - Probably want to send a message, if possible,
        but then really do the dequeue as well
  *  Not just hacking the usbredirparser, but proper patches
  *  Expose a sysfs attribute and have udev use it
  *  Turn on more capabilities and watch it go
  *  Check the seqnum against a max, and wrap it deliberately
