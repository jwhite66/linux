TODO:
  *  Note - during testing, having a device die unexpectedly
     could go on to cause fairly serious problems.  Need to
     explore that.
  *  Still getting sporadic failures
     - One clue - got an unexpected rc from the write in redir.c
  *  Hmm.  KFP_ATOMIC on our mallocs may be better than _KERNEL...
  *  Read and deal with the many TODOs
  *  Not just hacking the usbredirparser, but proper patches
     - The filter needs love.  Use strsep, not strtok?
  *  Expose a sysfs attribute and have udev use it
  *  Turn on more capabilities and watch it go
