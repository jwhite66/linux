USB Redirection Kernel Module

This module allows a Linux system to instatiate USB devices
that are located on a remote device.  The USB data is transferred
over a socket using the USBREDIR protocol, which is generally
used in conjunction with the SPICE project.

Temporary debug notes for Jeremy as he builds:
  * Entry points of note:
    - We start in hcd.c by registering our driver,
      and our device
    - Real action happens in sysfs.c when a store is made
      - That starts 2 threads; an rx, and a tx
      - The event thread was started at startup
