TODO:
  *  Read and deal with the many TODOs
  *  Make a dequeue_urb work correctly.
      - Probably want to send a message, if possible,
        but then really do the dequeue as well
  *  Why does an rmmod with an active connection hang?
     -  Seems a side effect of having an outbound urb get 'dropped'
        That is, at this moment in time, USB_DIR_OUT packets are dropped

  *  More than one root hub?  otw, limited to 32 or so connections...
  *  Not just hacking the usbredirparser, but proper patches
  *  Why is the thumb drive read only
  *  Expose a sysfs attribute and have udev use it
  *  Turn on more capabilities and watch it go
