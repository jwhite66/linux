TODO:
  *  Make a dequeue_urb work correctly.
      - Probably want to send a message, if possible,
        but then really do the dequeue as well
  *  Why does an rmmod with an active connection hang?
     -  Seems a side effect of having an outbound urb get 'dropped'
        That is, at this moment in time, USB_DIR_OUT packets are dropped

  *  More than one root hub?  otw, limited to 32 or so connections...
  *  Not just hacking the usbredirparser, but proper patches
