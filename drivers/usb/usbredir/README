USB Redirection Kernel Module

This module allows a Linux system to instatiate USB devices
that are located on a remote device.  The USB data is transferred
over a socket using the USBREDIR protocol, which is generally
used in conjunction with the SPICE project.

Temporary debug notes for Jeremy as he builds:
  * Entry points of note:
    - We start in main.c by registering our driver
    - Real action happens in sysfs.c when a store is made
    - That should create a hub, and then a device
      - That starts 2 threads; an rx, and a tx
  * We wait for urb transmission before actually
    considering a usb device fully instantiated.
    That is, we set a bit, tell the kernel to poll,
    and then after poll, it's supposed to do a port status;
    we pick up on that and grab the usb device then.
    Seems a bit convoluted to me.
